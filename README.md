# ninja-skeleton
Bootstrap Django like a ninja! No more making all those files
manually. This highlights some examples of file management and argparse handling
This is a common way of handling passing in arguments to a script
when you are running something form a command line.

This has the following requirements:
1) django-admin must be accessible in your path
2) you must specify the directory you want the directory tree to be created_at
or it will use the working directory where this is run
